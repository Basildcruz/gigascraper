===========

Gigaset phone database script for greek phone numbers. 
Uses ote whitepages for the actual name resultion. 

Just hacked this thing together because the phone didn't had integration
to lookup greek numbers

Tested on Gigaset 510IP, and it works fine !

To use it, upload on a server (http://whatever.yours/lookup.php), set the url field, leave username,
password empty and apply the configuration.
